**Autonomous AI Agents for Physical Prototyping — powered by Spindle**

Spindle Agent Kit is an experimental toolkit for building programmable agents that can design, verify, and iterate hardware products — from natural-language prompts to real-world prototypes.

This project extends the capabilities of [Spindle](https://spindlestudio.pro), a next-gen AI-powered workspace that converts ideas into manufacturable schematics, CAD, firmware, and bill of materials (BOM). With spindle-agent-kit, you can automate and orchestrate these flows using code.

## 🧩 Why This Exists

Prototyping hardware is traditionally:

- **Fragmented**: Requires juggling 5+ tools for CAD, PCB, sourcing, firmware, simulation.
- **Slow**: Each iteration takes days to weeks.
- **Manual**: Engineers spend more time formatting files than solving problems.
- **Exclusive**: Hard for solo builders or software-native teams to enter hardware space.

**Spindle changes that.** And this SDK helps you supercharge it with automation.

You can now build AI agents that:

- Convert text into real design files
- Simulate & validate designs
- Remix or fork existing hardware
- Deploy prototypes to manufacturing pipelines
- Integrate with other systems (GitHub, Notion, LLMs, JLCPCB, etc.)

## 🔧 What You Can Build With This Kit

- 🛠 Self-improving hardware agents
- 🔁 Auto-remixing assistants for public hardware libraries
- 🤖 Prompt-to-product generators
- 🌐 Web platforms with CAD/code generation backends
- ⚙️ Custom workflows for internal R&D teams
- 🧪 QA bots that test design constraints before fab

## 🔌 Plugin System

You can extend this kit by adding your own plugin modules:
plugin-verifier — AI-based design QA and compliance checks
plugin-jlcpcb — Submit fabrication orders automatically
plugin-openSCAD — Procedural 3D modeling from prompt
plugin-git-agent — Commit outputs to GitHub repos
plugin-llm-planner — Let LLMs decide next steps in design loop

## 🔐 Security & Ethics

This kit respects user ownership. All outputs belong to the user.

Avoid misuse: do not deploy agents for military or surveillance hardware unless fully disclosed and audited.

Always validate generated designs before manufacturing.

## 🗺 Roadmap

Prompt-to-Prototype action
